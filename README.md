# early-model-failure-detection
This repository explores the problem of early failure detection in predictive systems — identifying when a model or system is becoming misaligned with its environment before performance collapse occurs.
I’m investigating whether there are measurable signals that indicate when a model is no longer adapting to changing conditions, and whether those signals can be detected early enough to trigger meaningful intervention.
I’m interested in systems that operate in dynamic environments — such as education platforms or financial models — where delayed feedback can cause real harm. I want to understand how systems can monitor themselves and adapt before failure becomes visible.

A conceptual essay outlining the motivation and framework for this project can be found in /essays.
